# Podlove Podcasting Plugin for WordPress

Work before progress. Feel free to touch but handle with care.

## Wanna help? Cool! Here's how

1. Fork this project
2. `git clone --recursive git@github.com:<yourname>/podlove.git` Be sure to add the `--recursive` as we're using [git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).
3. Develop, develop, develop!
4. Send me a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
